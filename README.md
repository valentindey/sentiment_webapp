sentiment_webapp
================

This is a small app I built some time ago for my bachelor thesis on
_Comparing and Combining Rule Based and Machine Learning Techniques for Sentiment Analysis_.
(And I never worked on it afterwards)

I implemented a very naive rule based sentiment classifier and trained some ML
models on different data sets (imdb movie reviews, yelp restaurant reviews and
some combination thereof). It was fun doing it and I successfully graduated.
However, there are tons of more advanced approaches out there. So if you're
looking for fancy sentiment analysis or ML or even cool web apps, this is the
wrong place, sorry.

If still interested you can use all this under MIT License.
